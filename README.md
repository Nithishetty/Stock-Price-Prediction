# Stock-Price-Prediction
 The primary objective of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data  using advanced time series forecasting technique
Implement and compare the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for stock 
price prediction. 
• Evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model using metrics such as Root Mean 
Squared Error (RMSE). 
• Provide insights into the strengths and limitations of LSTM and ARIMA models in 
capturing the complex dynamics of stock price movements. 
• Generate visualizations to illustrate the predicted versus actual stock prices, enhancing 
interpretability and demonstrating the models' efficacy. 
• The Stock Dashboard project seeks to address these issues by developing a 
comprehensive tool that integrates various functionalities into a single, user-friendly 
interface. The project aims to provide real-time access to essential stock metrics, 
including the latest stock price, Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving 
Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence 
Divergence (MACD). These metrics are crucial for investors to assess the current state 
and historical performance of a stock. 
• A key aspect of the project is its ability to visualize data effectively. Utilizing libraries 
such as Plotly, the dashboard generates interactive charts and graphs that display 
historical prices, daily stock price heatmaps, and forecasted trends. This visual 
representation helps users to easily identify patterns and anomalies in stock 
performance, facilitating better decision-making. The interactive nature of these visual 
tools allows users to zoom in on specific time periods, compare different stocks, and 
customize their views to suit their individual analysis needs. 
• The project also incorporates predictive analytics to forecast future stock prices. By 
implementing a linear regression model and an ARIMA model, the dashboard can 
predict future trends based on historical data. This feature is invaluable for investors 
looking to anticipate market movements and make proactive investment choices. 
• The inclusion of multiple predictive models provides robustness to the forecasting 
capability, allowing users to compare outputs from different methods and gain a more 
nuanced understanding of potential future price movements
